# customizeumbrella✌️
This code is a fun and interactive custom umbrella designer built with React. It allows users to pick from different color options and even upload their own logo to see it on the umbrella in real-time. The code also includes animations and styling to bring the design to life. To use this component, you'll need to have React and its dependencies set up. Additionally, make sure the image file paths are correct so the images can be displayed properly.

You're welcome to use this code as a foundation for your own umbrella designer or use it as is. If you run into any issues or have any questions, please let us know by opening a GitHub issue.
